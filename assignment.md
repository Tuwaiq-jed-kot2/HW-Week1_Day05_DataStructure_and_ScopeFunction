# Kotlin Essentials (Data Structure /Scope Functions)
---
The Kotlin assignment has three components
- Practice with Scope Functions.
- Practice with Lists and Sets.
- Practice with Maps.

> Note: You must save your solution as `solution_part1.kt` for Part I, `solution_part2.kt` for Part II, and `solution_part3.kt` for Part III.

## Part I - with Scope Functions.Optional to do = Bonus!!
---
- Create a working exmaple withing 'Let'  (Optional to do = Bonus!!)
- Create a working exmaple withing 'Run'  (Optional to do = Bonus!!)
- Create a working exmaple withing 'Also'  (Optional to do = Bonus!!)

## Part II - Practice with Lists and Sets.
---
- Create a list and access it and print it, then update or add elements to it
- Create a list and access out of its bounds, then manage the array errors safety with 3 different ways
- Create a list then add repetitive and unique elements to it, then convert it to set, then add new elements to it and print the set values

## Part III - Practice with Maps.
---
- Write an asnwer to this question: What are the cases that I need to use the map for??
- we use it when we have a 2 object one of them have unique value, map is collection of (keys and values). 
key should be unique elements, valve accept repetitive elements 
- What is the difference between immutable and read only variables?
- Read only : we can't reassign the value after initialized. val is a read only variable 
- for example /  val x : Int
                     x = 0 
- Immutable : can't change the state of object  
- Create a map of 20 elements of strings and doubles
